# SpacePy install script

SpacePy 
[install procedure](https://pythonhosted.org/SpacePy/dependencies.html) 
notes that several prereqs are required to get SpacePy installed.
Note that if you just need CDF read/write capability, consider 
[CDFlib](https://pypi.org/project/cdflib/),
which is a pure Python CDF library.

This install script uses only Python itself with no external dependencies besides a C compiler to build the NASA CDF library.
